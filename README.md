# Game-Assets

The repo contains 2D game assets.

## More About the Repo

In the repo, I share the game assets I've made for my work. I am a developer, and I use the game assets offered by great graphic designers in the game design community. Instead of keeping my humble work to myself, I think it is more valuable to share it with you. I hope you find something useful for you. You can also find the assets in the my [itch.io account](https://senderin.itch.io) .
