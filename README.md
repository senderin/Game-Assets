# Game-Assets

In the repo, I share the game assets I've made for my work. I am a developer, and I use the game assets offered by great graphic designers in the game design community. Instead of keeping my humble work to myself, I think it is more valuable to share it with you. I hope you find something useful for you.

Also, you can find the links of resources such as websites and blogs that I use while making these assets. *I would like to thank these people, who shared their knowledge and helped us develop together.*
